**Repository for The Coolest Project**

## Description
This is a very detailed description for [The Coolest Project](https://gitlab.rebrainme.com/devops_users_repos/4556/rebrain-devops-task1). Imagine, that this project is a cli (_command-line interface_) client-server tool, that allows user to perform their tasks using remote resources, namely with virtual machines. Our system can allocate new resources using `oVirt` virtualisation.

This tool has been developed to automate users' access to remote capacities without disturbing the Devops specialist. Also exploiting this tool by user **guarantees the safety and consistency of both each virtual machine and the entire Ovirt system**. Using this tool user can perform the following things:
- Authorizing in remote system and get access to personal pool by the unique token;
- Leasing new VMs by specifying:
    - Linux distro (available: `RedHat`, `Debian`, `Fedora`, `CentOS`)
    - Memory (from 512MB to 4GB included)
    - Storage space (from 10GB to 30GB included)
    - CPU (from 1 to 4 included)
    - Leasing time (**max leasing time = 1 month**)
- Deleting its own VMs (and freeing up the remote resources);
- Using VMs until their expiration date;
- Viewing your VMs list.

This Coolest tool may be compiled as a stand-alone binary using `Golang`.

> It supports some specification version [infinity+1](https://www.critterbabies.com/animals/cats-kittens/).

## Installation

You can install this tool using most Linux package managers, such as `dpkg`, `yum`, `dnf`, `pacman`. For example (Fedora):

```
sudo dnf install cool-tool
```

But you can also install it by cloning this repo and build the binary manually (see section **Builbing** below):

```
git clone git@gitlab.rebrainme.com:devops_users_repos/4556/rebrain-devops-task1.git
```


## Building
This project is a Go module (see golang.org Module information for explanation).
The dependencies for this project are listed in the go.mod file.

To build the source, execute `make clean build`.

To run unit tests, execute `make test`.

To build an image, execute `make docker`.

## Configuration

To set the configuration under your environment follow the detail [configuration setup]().

## Using Tool

Firstly, to get access to `oVirt` through the `cool-tool` you just need to get token from those who has admin rights and authorize:

```
$cool-tool connect
```

Then you need to insert your token to the terminal (token will not be displayed).
> Authorization (access to the tool, not to VMs) ends for 10 minutes of inactivity

To lease new VM you need to execute

```
$cool-tool lease --name <new-vm-1> --distro <distro> --memory <amount of memory> --storage <amount of storage> --cpu <cpu capacity> --time <leasing time>
```

> Arguments `name` and `time` are optional. Default name for VM is *new-vm-<#>* and default leasing time is **_1 day_**.

To view list of your VMs execute

```
$cool-tool list
```

> Maximum amount of VMs = 5

To remove VM whose inspiration date has not yet come with

```
$cool-tool remove <vm-id>
```

> Be carefully, the command above frees the resources and erases all data that belonged to your VM

Finally, you can connect to one of your VM via ssh.
